<p><em>Awaken your Sacred Divine and Purpose</em></p>

<p><em>Healing One Womb At A Time!!</p>

<p>I guide you through In the sacred space of ceremony, I facilitate rituals that transcend time, creating bridges between 
the seen and the unseen. Guided by the wisdom of my ancestors, I offer healing rites that cleanse, empower, and illuminate 
the path to self-discovery and ancestral connection. My journey is one of embodied healingâ€”a dance with the energies that 
course through our veins and the echoes of our lineage. Through this sacred dance, I empower others to embrace their own 
ancestral stories, finding strength in the roots that ground them and wisdom in the whispers of their forebears. 

As an earthbound alchemist, I delve into the potent energies of nature, invoking the spirits of the land and the elements to aid in 
the sacred work of restoration. From the rustle of ancient trees to the whispering winds, I draw inspiration and strength, 
channeling these primal forces to bring harmony to the souls that seek solace.Once you have seen me you have seen Sweetness, you 
have seen love, you have seen beauty and a giver of life, you have seen the Ancestral Healer. I am a compassionate teacher and 
vessel of healing. I hold various Certifications, studied under various folkore healers, elders, and Priestesses in which i am a 
Reiki Master/Teacher, Womb Wellness Guide,, Elemental Doula and Postpartum healer , Yoni Gem Priestess, Yoni Peristeam Therapist, plant medicine wombman 
and Afro-Cuban Lucumi devotee.

As a Ancestral Healer  my purpose is to guide those to apply the ancient and modern philosophies of self-discovery. By honoring 
our personal values, we develop a harmonious connection to the mind, body, soul, and world. Join me on this mystical journey as we 
honor the past, heal the present, and illuminate the future. Together, let us weave a tapestry of resilience, love, and ancestral grace. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒŒâœ¨ conflict and stagnation brought on by an ever-evolving life.
