<h1>Welcome to Ancient Paradigm Tribe</h1>

<p><em>Awaken your Sacred Divine and Purpose</em></p>

<p><em>Healing One Womb At A Time!!</p>

<p>As guided by the wisdom of my ancestors,elders,guides,and meastros, I offer healing rites that cleanse, empower, and 
illuminate the path to self-discovery and ancestral connection. My journey is one of embodied healing‚Äîa dance with the energies 
that course through our veins and the echoes of our lineage. Through this sacred dance, I empower others to embrace their own 
ancestral stories, finding strength in the roots that ground them and wisdom in the whispers of their forebears.</p>

<p>As an earthbound alchemist, I delve into the potent energies of nature, invoking the spirits of the land and the elements to 
aid in the sacred work of restoration. From the rustle of ancient trees to the whispering winds, I draw inspiration and strength, 
channeling these primal forces to bring harmony to the souls that seek solace.Once you have seen me you have seen Sweetness, you 
have seen love, you have seen beauty and a giver of life, you have seen the Ancestral Healer. I am a compassionate teacher and 
vessel of healing. I hold various Certifications, studied under various folkore healers, elders, and Priestesses in which i am a 
Reiki Master/Teacher, Womb Wellness Guide,, Elemental Doula and Postpartum healer , Yoni Gem Priestess, Yoni Peristeam Therapist, plant medicine wombman 
and Afro-Cuban Lucumi devotee.</p>

<p>As a Ancestral Healer  my purpose is to guide those to apply the ancient and modern philosophies of self-discovery. By honoring 
our personal values, we develop a harmonious connection to the mind, body, soul, and world. Join me on this mystical journey as we 
honor the past, heal the present, and illuminate the future. Together, let us weave a tapestry of resilience, love, and ancestral 
graceüåøüåå‚ú® conflict and stagnation brought on by an ever-evolving life.</p>

giving us the tools and resources needed to get on the right path to healthy sleep patterns for our little one. She also is an 
amazing postpartum healer. The sobadas, belly binding and bajos protocol were so nourishing. I am grateful for her support and the wealth of knowledge that she has provided to us. She has given us the confidence as parents to move forward 
with a routine that is customized to our family/household, and we can finally see the light at the end of tunnel!‚Äù  </p>

takes a Indigenous Holistic approach backed by sound research, but is also caring, nurturing and really gets to know the children
and family. She put a customized plan together and literally within 1-2 nights of following the plan, our girls were sleeping 
through the night with the exception of one feeding. My only regret is not doing this earlier! I give my highest recommendation to 
the Elemental Doula!‚Äù  </p>
